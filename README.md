**TL;DR** We propose a knowledge distillation based ap- proach towards melanoma detection. The goal is build a model with few parameters that can accurately detect melanoma and can be easily integrated without requiring much compute. It enables us to build small and performant models which can be easily deployed in clinical settings without the need for heavy computational costs.
